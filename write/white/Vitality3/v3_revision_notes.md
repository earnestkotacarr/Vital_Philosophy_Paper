# V3 Revision Notes for Ralph

## What Already Exists
- `Vitality3.md` and `Vitality3.tex` — a first-pass draft already incorporating some of these notes (Klopf, Sepulchre, autonomy definition, colloquial tone, trimmed length, abstract todos). Cross-reference and improve.
- `v3_synthesis.md` — synthesis of the V3 vision
- `critique_symbols_and_entropy.md` — the two structural critiques (symbols + entropy)
- `critique_followup_research.md` — follow-up research (interventional vitality, constructor theory, etc.)
- `Vitality2_171225.tex` in `../Vitality2/` — V2 paper whose STRUCTURE (not content) to lean on
- `EarnestKotaCarr_BOOSTNAIS.pdf` — the BOOST NAIS application grounding everything in play

## What Needs to Happen (Revise Both .md and .tex, Keep In Sync)

### 1. Tone
Internal paper. Colloquial is fine. Cut academic bloat. Say things directly.

### 2. Cut Length
First draft was too verbose. Be concise. The reader is us.

### 3. Drop Constructor Theory from Todos
No causal mechanism — doesn't give us what we need. Remove all constructor-theoretic content from Section 5.

### 4. Rewrite Section 5 (Todos) — More Abstract
The todos should be:
- **Defining the bidirectional intrinsic motivation in causal and computationally tractable terms.** E-P has the right structure but MI is causally blind and intractable. Need a formulation that preserves the bidirectional oscillatory character but in causal, computable terms. Gunji and Pegios's "Natural-Born Intelligence as the Invocation of Emotion = Politics" may be crucial — connects bidirectional engagement to non-information-theoretic quantities.
- **Getting both indexing AND feature extraction from representation learning.** VQ-VAE indexes but no algebraic structure. Ohmura extracts structure but no indexed vocabulary. Need both in one system — discrete inventory of structurally meaningful features where indexing and structure are the same thing.
- **Integrating both so representation learning is constrained by the higher-order mother-of-all-valleys intrinsic motivation.** The E-P (or its causal successor) should be the master landscape. Features are valuable because they expand bidirectional engagement, not because they compress or reconstruct. Representation learning should be constitutively constrained by intrinsic motivation.

### 5. Add Klopf's Critique of Cybernetics
Harry Klopf (1982, The Hedonistic Neuron) critiqued cybernetics for only having negative feedback (homeostasis). Living systems also need positive feedback (heterostasis) — seeking stimulation, escalating challenges, pursuing novelty. Rodolphe Sepulchre's "control across scales" makes the same point from engineering: robust systems need BOTH positive and negative feedback coupled.

This maps directly onto E-P: empowerment = positive feedback (self-amplifying, expanding influence), plasticity = negative feedback (self-regulating, accommodating). The Turing pattern morphogen dynamics ARE the coupled pos-neg feedback.

### 6. Clarify Autonomy Definition
**Autonomy = self-regulation + self-amplification.**
Not just homeostasis (Wiener/Ashby). Not just heterostasis (Klopf). Both coupled. Self-regulating side (plasticity, negative feedback, accommodation) keeps the system viable. Self-amplifying side (empowerment, positive feedback, assimilation) drives expanded engagement. This is what Sepulchre demands, what Klopf diagnosed as missing, and what play provides naturally.

### 7. Keep .md and .tex in Sync
Both files must have identical content in their respective formats.
