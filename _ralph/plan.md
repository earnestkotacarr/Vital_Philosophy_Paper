# Vitality3 Paper Revision - Round 3b (Correction)

## Context
Round 3 completed tasks 0-4 (typo fix, dual-dual, Trevarthen, autonomy expansion) but the AUTONOMY framing is WRONG. Must be corrected.

Keep .md and .tex in sync. Flowing prose. Colloquial internal paper.

## THE CORRECTION

Round 3 Task 2 framed autonomy as having TWO senses (viability autonomy + play autonomy). This is WRONG. The correct framing:

- **Viability is NOT autonomous.** Viability is purely negative feedback control. It is reactive — it requires outside perturbation to produce any behavior. A thermostat is viable. Viability just keeps the system within survivable bounds. There is no self-generated movement in viability alone.
- **Only Vitality has genuine autonomy.** The E-P Turing oscillator generates its own movement. It self-amplifies (empowerment, positive feedback) AND self-regulates (plasticity, negative feedback) as a coupled system. This is self-generated movement — autonomy in the proper sense. The oscillator doesn't need external perturbation to produce behavior; it generates its own developmental dynamics.
- **So: viability = negative feedback control (reactive, not autonomous). Vitality = autonomy (self-generated movement via coupled positive-negative feedback).**

Fix this EVERYWHERE it was written wrong in Round 3. Check §1.3 (Definition of Autonomy), §5.4 (Clarifying Autonomy), and anywhere else autonomy is discussed. Make sure viability is characterized as purely reactive negative feedback, and autonomy is attributed to vitality (the E-P regime) alone.

| Task | Description | Complete |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 0 | Read current V3 drafts. Find everywhere autonomy/viability is discussed. | false |
| 1 | Fix the autonomy framing: viability = purely negative feedback (not autonomous), vitality = genuine autonomy (self-generated movement). Fix in both .md and .tex. | false |
| 2 | Final pass: coherence, flow, .md/.tex sync. | false |
