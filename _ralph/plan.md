# Vitality3 Paper Revision - Round 4

## Context
Round 3 added a "Dual-Dual Structure" section (§1.6) but got the second duality wrong — it described three layers mapping to super-conscious/conscious/sub-conscious. The actual second duality is the **dual-laws model** (Ohmura et al.): the difference between the symbolic/index layer and the lower control-dynamics layer. This round corrects §1.6 and anywhere else the dual-dual idea appears.

## THE CORRECT DUAL-DUAL STRUCTURE

**First duality**: The E-P dialectic — empowerment and plasticity oscillating, co-regulating each other in the Turing-style pattern. This is the bidirectional engagement.

**Second duality**: The dual-laws model. The system operates at TWO levels simultaneously, and feedback error is independently influenced by both:

- **Supervenience level (symbolic/index layer)**: Composed of multiple supervenient functions. Equations are defined by combining these functions, and the combination is determined by an *index sequence*. The dynamical laws at this level modify the index sequence — this is **Type 2 processing**: discrete, exploratory, adjusting WHICH equations are active by reordering or selecting index sequences. This is the symbolic abstraction capacity.

- **Base level (neuronal/dynamics layer)**: Neurons, synapses, and other components that constitute the supervenient functions. These adjust to satisfy the equations defined at the supervenience level. This is **Type 1 processing**: continuous, goal-directed, inter-level feedback control that modifies the functions themselves.

The key insight: the feedback error can be reduced EITHER by changing the index sequence at the top (Type 2, discrete) OR by adjusting neural states at the bottom (Type 1, continuous). Both operate independently on the same error signal. This is what makes the dual-laws model work.

This maps onto dual process theory:
- Type 1 = continuous adjustment of the functions themselves (base level)
- Type 2 = discrete control through index sequence modification (supervenience level)

The dual-dual is: (1) E-P dialectic, (2) dual-laws Type 1/Type 2 across symbolic and neuronal levels.

**THEN** — after establishing the dual-dual in formal terms — we can observe that this gives rise to a **triadic structure**: the E-P intrinsic motivation at top (super-conscious), the symbolic index-sequence layer in the middle (conscious), and the neuronal/dynamics base layer at bottom (sub-conscious). But the triadic observation comes AFTER the dual-laws explanation, as a consequence, not as the primary framing. The formal structure is the dual-laws model; the triadic mapping is a remark on what that structure looks like.

| Task | Description | Complete |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 0 | Read current §1.6 and anywhere else the dual-dual appears. | false |
| 1 | Rewrite §1.6 with the correct dual-dual: E-P dialectic + dual-laws model (Type 1 continuous base-level / Type 2 discrete index-sequence). Then AFTER that, add the triadic observation (super-conscious IM / conscious symbolic / sub-conscious neuronal) as a consequence, not the primary framing. | false |
| 2 | Check rest of paper for any references to the old three-layer framing and fix. | false |
| 3 | Final pass: coherence, flow, .md/.tex sync. | false |
