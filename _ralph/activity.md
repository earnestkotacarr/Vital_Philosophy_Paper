## Project: Vitality3 Paper Revision — Round 3b (Correction)
Started: 2026-02-07

Round 3 (tasks 0-5) completed but the autonomy framing was wrong — it said viability has autonomy too. WRONG. Viability is purely negative feedback, not autonomous. Only Vitality has autonomy. This round corrects that.

## Iteration 1 (Tasks 0-2)
Completed: 2026-02-07

### Task 0: Read and locate autonomy/viability discussions
Read both Vitality3.md and Vitality3.tex. Located problematic sections:
- §1.3 Definition of Autonomy (lines 37-39 .md, lines 67-70 .tex)
- §5.4 Clarifying Autonomy (lines 245-260 .md, lines 303-318 .tex)

Both sections wrongly characterized viability as "the first sense of autonomy." This contradicts the correction requirement.

### Task 1: Fix autonomy framing
**§1.3 Definition of Autonomy** — Replaced two-senses framing with correct distinction:
- OLD: "Autonomy operates in two senses: (1) viability maintains organism, (2) E-P oscillator is autonomous"
- NEW: "Viability is purely negative feedback (reactive, NOT autonomous). Only the E-P oscillator has genuine autonomy (self-generated movement via coupled positive-negative feedback)."
- Added: "Viability keeps you alive. Vitality makes you autonomous."

**§5.4 Clarifying Autonomy** — Same correction pattern:
- OLD: "Autonomy operates in two senses: viability-autonomy and play-autonomy"
- NEW: "Autonomy distinguishes from viability. Viability = purely negative feedback (not autonomous). E-P oscillator = genuine autonomy."
- Emphasized: "A thermostat is viable" but not autonomous. "Viability requires external perturbation." Only the E-P oscillator generates self-movement.

Both files (.md and .tex) updated in sync.

### Task 2: Final coherence pass
- Grepped for all "viab" occurrences — confirmed only corrected characterizations remain
- Grepped for "autonom.*viab" patterns — confirmed no wrong framings
- Read §1.3 in both files — perfect sync
- Read §5.4 in both files — perfect sync
- Verified flowing prose throughout (no bullets introduced)

**Result:** The autonomy/viability distinction is now correct throughout both files. Viability is purely negative feedback control (reactive, not autonomous). Vitality (the E-P oscillator) is genuine autonomy (self-generated developmental dynamics).
