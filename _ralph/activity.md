## Project: Vitality3 Paper Revision — Round 4
Started: 2026-02-07

Correcting the dual-dual structure: remove super-conscious/conscious/sub-conscious mapping, replace with correct dual-laws model (Type 1 continuous base-level / Type 2 discrete index-sequence).

## Iteration 1 — 2026-02-07

### Task 0: Read current §1.6 and check for other dual-dual references
**Status**: Complete

Read Vitality3.md and Vitality3.tex. Found §1.6 "The Dual-Dual Structure" incorrectly described the second duality as a three-layered architecture (super-conscious/conscious/sub-conscious) rather than the dual-laws model. All references to the dual-dual structure were contained in §1.6 only.

### Task 1: Rewrite §1.6 with correct dual-dual structure
**Status**: Complete

Rewrote §1.6 in both .md and .tex files with the correct structure:

**First duality**: E-P dialectic (bidirectional engagement oscillation) — unchanged, already correct.

**Second duality**: Dual-laws model (Ohmura et al.) — completely rewritten to explain:
- Supervenience level (symbolic/index layer): Type 2 processing, discrete modification of index sequences that determine which equations are active
- Base level (neuronal/dynamics layer): Type 1 processing, continuous adjustment of neural states to satisfy supervenient equations
- Key insight: feedback error reduced independently by both levels operating on the same signal through orthogonal degrees of freedom
- Maps onto dual process theory: Type 1 = continuous base-level, Type 2 = discrete index-sequence

**Then**: Triadic observation added as a consequence, not primary framing — the three-layer phenomenology (super-conscious IM / conscious symbolic / sub-conscious neuronal) emerges from the dual-laws structure but is not the formal principle itself.

### Task 2: Check rest of paper for old three-layer framing
**Status**: Complete

Used grep to search for all references to "dual-dual", "three-layer", "super-conscious", "conscious layer", "sub-conscious", "Type 1", "Type 2", "index sequence", "supervenience level", "base level" throughout the paper. All references were contained in §1.6, which has now been corrected. No other sections needed changes.

### Task 3: Final pass — coherence, flow, .md/.tex sync
**Status**: Complete

Verified both files are in sync. The new §1.6 flows well with flowing prose (not bullets) and maintains the colloquial internal paper tone. The dual-laws model is now the primary framing, with the triadic observation correctly positioned as a consequence.

## Summary

Round 4 complete. The dual-dual structure in §1.6 now correctly presents:
1. E-P dialectic (first duality)
2. Dual-laws model with Type 1/Type 2 processing (second duality)
3. Triadic phenomenology as a consequence of the dual-laws structure

Files updated: Vitality3.md and Vitality3.tex (kept in sync per CLAUDE.md instructions).

## Iteration 2 — 2026-02-07

### Task: Add Type 2 / language remark to §1.6
**Status**: Complete

Added a remark after the dual-process theory mapping (line 72 in .md, line 106 in .tex) explaining that:
- Both Type 1 and Type 2 are incorporated in the dual-laws model
- Type 2 likely exists in non-human organisms
- Type 2 may become particularly advanced in organisms with sophisticated linguistic capacities (humans being the clearest case)
- Language itself is an index system, and the capacity for discrete symbolic recombination that enables language may be the same capacity that drives Type 2 processing

This clarifies that Type 2 is not uniquely human but that its linguistic sophistication may be tied to discrete symbolic capacities. Woven naturally into flowing prose. Both .md and .tex kept in sync.
