## Critical: Keep Files in Sync

When editing `Vital_Philosophy.md`, **always** update `Vital_Philosophy.tex` with the same changes. The markdown and LaTeX files must stay synchronized.

- Abstract changes → update both files
- Section changes → update both files
- New subsections → update both files
- Conclusion changes → update both files
- Reference additions → update both files

Never commit changes to just one file without updating the other.
