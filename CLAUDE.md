## Critical: Keep Files in Sync

When editing files in `write/philosophy/`, **always** keep the `.md` and `.tex` versions in sync. For example, changes to `write/philosophy/Vital_Philosophy.md` must also be applied to `write/philosophy/Vital_Philosophy.tex`.

- Abstract changes → update both files
- Section changes → update both files
- New subsections → update both files
- Conclusion changes → update both files
- Reference additions → update both files

Never commit changes to just one file without updating the other.
